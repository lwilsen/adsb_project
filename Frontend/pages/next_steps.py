This data is pretty knowledge/experience specific, meaning that if you don't have experience 
working with this kind of data, the relationships between all the variables is going to be
difficult to understand. Because of this, a prediction focused project or tool is going to 
be much less useful. Because of this, I think a focus on understanding the underlying relationships
between the variables in this dataset is warranted. A presentation of the relationships beween
the variables would allow viewers to then accurately use the prediction tool to investigate
and observe those relationships themselves. (Plus, data visualization and exploration with a
focus on specific knowledge transfer would give me something useful to do!)
