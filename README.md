# Project idea 1

## Welcome to my data science project. I'm still exploring options for this repo, but I think that I'll be looking into the project described below.

### Tampa Area Flight Patterns

Using ADSB and potentially meteorological data, I want to investigate

- If there are is any predictability behind flight delays in the Tampa Bay area
- If it is possible to classify aircraft type/category based on flight patterns (speed, altitude ... etc.)
- Any emergency or alert indicators and the possibility of predicting them
- If it is possible to identify "strange" flight behaviors and what caused them

I also want to explore a more visual based exploration, and actually map out specific flight patterns.
