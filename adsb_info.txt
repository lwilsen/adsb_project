### Thoughts/Considerations

- Need to check length of response, potential for differing number of headers/columns

Explanation of columns
Interpreting ADSB Exchange Data Values
Basic Aircraft Information
hex: A unique hexadecimal identifier assigned to each aircraft. It's essentially a digital fingerprint for the aircraft.
type: This indicates the type of ADSB message being transmitted. In this case, adsb_icao suggests a standard ICAO-formatted message.
flight: The flight number of the aircraft.
r: The registration number of the aircraft, often a combination of letters and numbers.
t: The aircraft type, typically a model designation (e.g., Boeing 737).
alt_baro: The barometric altitude of the aircraft in feet.
alt_geom: The geometric altitude of the aircraft in feet. This is calculated based on GPS data and is generally more accurate than barometric altitude.
gs: The ground speed of the aircraft in knots.
track: The heading of the aircraft in degrees, measured clockwise from north.
baro_rate: The rate of climb or descent of the aircraft in feet per minute.
squawk: A four-digit code used for identification and coordination. It's often used to indicate emergencies or special conditions.
emergency: A flag indicating whether an emergency has been declared.
category: The aircraft category, which helps classify aircraft based on size and type.
lat: The latitude of the aircraft in degrees.
lon: The longitude of the aircraft in degrees.
nic: The number of independent components (NIC) used for position determination. This indicates the accuracy and reliability of the position data.
rc: The receiver capability of the aircraft's ADSB equipment.
seen_pos: The time since the last position report was received in seconds.
version: The version of the ADSB message format.
Additional Data
nic_baro: The NIC used for barometric altitude determination.
nac_p: The navigation accuracy class for position, indicating the expected accuracy of the position data.
nac_v: The navigation accuracy class for velocity, indicating the expected accuracy of the velocity data.
sil: The surveillance information link (SIL) capability of the aircraft.
sil_type: The type of SIL being used.
gva: The global vertical accuracy of the position data.
sda: The surveillance data availability, indicating the frequency and reliability of the data transmission.
alert: A flag indicating whether an alert has been issued for the aircraft.
spi: The system performance indicator, providing information about the health and performance of the aircraft's ADSB system.
mlat: Multi-lateration data, used to determine the aircraft's position based on signals from multiple ground stations.
tisb: Terrestrial internet-based surveillance data, used for data transmission and reception.
messages: The total number of messages received from the aircraft.
seen: The time since the last message was received in seconds.
rssi: The received signal strength indicator, indicating the strength of the signal received from the aircraft.
dbFlags: Data block flags, used for various purposes, such as indicating the presence of specific data elements.
geom_rate: The geometric rate of climb or descent of the aircraft in feet per minute.
nav_qnh: The QNH barometric pressure at the airport.
nav_altitude_mcp: The navigation altitude set on the aircraft's flight management computer (FMC).
nav_heading: The navigation heading of the aircraft in degrees.
nav_modes: The navigation modes currently active on the aircraft.
true_heading: The true heading of the aircraft, taking into account wind direction and speed.
calc_track: The calculated track of the aircraft, based on its position and velocity.

Category types: 
A0 : No ADS-B emitter category information. Do not use this emitter category. If no emitter category fits your installation, seek guidance from the FAA as appropriate.

A1 : Light (< 15500 lbs) – Any airplane with a maximum takeoff weight less than 15,500 pounds. This includes very light aircraft (light sport aircraft) that do not meet the requirements of 14 CFR § 103.1.

A2 : Small (15500 to 75000 lbs) – Any airplane with a maximum takeoff weight greater than or equal to15,500 pounds but less than 75,000 pounds.

A3 : Large (75000 to 300000 lbs) – Any airplane with a maximum takeoff weight greater than or equal to 75,000 pounds but less than 300,000 pounds that does not qualify for the high vortex category.

A4 :  High vortex large (aircraft such as B-757) – Any airplane with a maximum takeoff weight greater than or equal to 75,000 pounds but less than 300,000 pounds that has been determined to generate a high wake vortex. Currently, the Boeing 757 is the only example.

A5 : Heavy (> 300000 lbs) – Any airplane with a maximum takeoff weight equal to or above 300,000 pounds.

A6 : High performance (> 5g acceleration and 400 kts) – Any airplane, regardless of weight, which can maneuver in excess of 5 G’s and maintain true airspeed above 400 knots.

A7 : Rotorcraft – Any rotorcraft regardless of weight.

B0 : No ADS-B emitter category information

B1 : Glider / sailplane – Any glider or sailplane regardless of weight.

B2 : Lighter-than-air – Any lighter than air (airship or balloon) regardless of weight.

B3 : Parachutist / skydiver

B4 : Ultralight / hang-glider / paraglider – A vehicle that meets the requirements of 14 CFR § 103.1. Light sport aircraft should not use the ultralight emitter category unless they meet 14 CFR § 103.1.

B5 : Reserved

B6 : Unmanned aerial vehicle – Any unmanned aerial vehicle or unmanned aircraft system regardless of weight.

B7 : Space / trans-atmospheric vehicle

C0 : No ADS-B emitter category information

C1 : Surface vehicle – emergency vehicle

C2 : Surface vehicle – service vehicle

C3 : Point obstacle (includes tethered balloons)

C4 : Cluster obstacle

C5 : Line obstacle

C6 : Reserved

C7 : Reserved
